      <h2>General interests</h2>

      <p>My research interests are centered around understanding how evolutionary change is facilitated and constrained,
      with the goal of adding to our more general understanding of patterns of biological diversification and complexity. I have
      have approached this interest through several different topics, but I primairly focus on studying life cycle evolution and 
      the evolution endosymbiotic interactions. I like to approach these topics from both genetic and ecological perspectives.
      </p>

      <p>While the overall goal of my research is to understand the generation of biodiversity, I 
        believe this goal could be of little use without the conservation of said diversity. Therefore,
        I am also interested in understanding the causes and consequences of anthropogenic environmental and ecological
        change. Specifically, I am interested in understanding the consequences of anthropogenic environmental 
        and ecological change on seasonal phenological dynamics.

      <h2>Life cycle evolution</h2>

      <p>Deeply rooted divergence
        between lineages has often coincided with principal life cycle alterations, so its possible that
        understanding how life cycles evolve (in both form and complexity) could lend general insight into 
        patterns of diversification throughout natural history. My work has predominately focused on understanding
        the genetic basis of life cycle evolution, focusing on how the various phenotypes presented by an organism
        throughout its life cycle evolutionary diverge from each other. More recently, I have recently started studying 
        the ecological factors that may facilitate and constrain life cycle evolution.

    <h2>Evolution of endosymbioses</h2>

    <p>
      Endosymbiotic interactions have played transformative roles in the evolution of hosts from across the tree of life.
      The most notable examples of this are mitochondria and chloroplast, but evolutionairly important endosymbioses 
      have independently arisen across diverse taxa. Therefore, it seems that major evolutionary trajectories can be 
      largely shaped by endosymbiotic interactions. My work has primairly focused on understanding how ecological processes
      shape the frequency of endosymbionts that are still segregating in host populations, with the objective of understanding 
      how the said ecological processes influence the evolutionary trajectories of endosymbiotic interacitons.
